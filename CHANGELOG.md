# Changelog

I am far too lazy to follow semver. The commit hash is the version. I suppose
if you wanted to see the hash for a particular section in this file, you could
use git blame.

## [Unreleased]

## 2021-05-14
### Added
- This changelog.

### Changed
- Just about everything; far too much to document here. But I'll keep this
  up-to-date going forward.
